# Proxy Registration

End-to-end guide for connecting existing zentinel proxy instances to the control plane.

> **Integration status — read this first**
>
> The control-plane side of everything in this guide (registration, heartbeats, bundle distribution, JWT auth, events/metrics ingestion) is implemented and working. The [zentinel proxy](https://github.com/zentinelproxy/zentinel) itself, however, does **not yet ship a built-in control-plane client**: there are no `control_plane_url`, `node_id`, or `node_key` settings in the proxy configuration, and a stock proxy binary will not register, send heartbeats, or pull bundles on its own.
>
> Until native support lands in the proxy, the node-facing API described below has to be driven by an external process you run next to the proxy — a sidecar script, cron job, or your own tooling. The control plane's built-in node simulator speaks the same API, which is how the end-to-end workflow is exercised today. Section 2 describes what a minimal sidecar must do.
>
> See the [README status section](../README.md#status) for the overall project status.

## Prerequisites

- Control plane running and accessible (see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md))
- An organization and project created in the control plane (see [GETTING-STARTED.md](GETTING-STARTED.md))
- The `zentinel` proxy binary installed on target machines
- `curl` or equivalent HTTP client for API calls

## 1. Register the Proxy

Register a node with the control plane via the REST API. No authentication is required for registration — only the project slug.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/projects/my-project/nodes/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "proxy-us-east-1",
    "labels": {"env": "production", "region": "us-east-1"},
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "ip": "10.0.1.50",
    "hostname": "proxy-us-east-1.internal"
  }'
```

### Request Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Unique name within the project (1-100 chars, alphanumeric + `_` `.` `-`) |
| `labels` | No | Key-value metadata for targeting rollouts |
| `version` | No | Proxy version string |
| `ip` | No | Node IP address (auto-detected from request if omitted) |
| `hostname` | No | Node hostname |
| `capabilities` | No | Feature capabilities array |
| `metadata` | No | Additional JSON metadata |

### Response

```json
{
  "node_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "node_key": "sk_abc123def456...",
  "poll_interval_s": 30
}
```

**Important:** The `node_key` is returned only once. Store it securely — it cannot be retrieved again.

## 2. Connect the Proxy (external sidecar required today)

The proxy has no native control-plane settings yet (see the status note at the top). The credentials from registration are consumed by whatever process you run alongside the proxy to speak the node API on its behalf:

| Value | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Control plane URL (e.g., `http://localhost:4000`) | Base URL for all node API calls |
| `node_id` from the registration response | Identifies the node in every API path |
| `node_key` from the registration response | Authenticates heartbeats, bundle polling, and event reporting |

A minimal sidecar loop must:

1. **Heartbeat** — `POST /api/v1/nodes/:node_id/heartbeat` every `poll_interval_s` seconds (see section 3 for the payload) so the node shows as "online".
2. **Poll for bundles** — `GET /api/v1/nodes/:node_id/bundles/latest`; when a rollout assigns a new bundle, download it from the presigned URL, verify the checksum, unpack the KDL config, and reload the proxy with it.
3. **Report back** — include the `active_bundle_id` in the next heartbeat so the rollout engine can track progress, and optionally report events and metrics (section 6).

All calls authenticate with the `X-Zentinel-Node-Key` header (or a JWT, see section 4). Example heartbeat:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/nodes/NODE_ID/heartbeat \
  -H "X-Zentinel-Node-Key: sk_abc123def456..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"version": "1.0.0"}'
```

## 3. Verify Connection

Once your sidecar (or other node-API client) is running and sending heartbeats, verify the connection:

**Check via the dashboard:** Navigate to your project in the web UI — the node should appear with status "online".

**Check via the API:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/api/v1/projects/my-project/nodes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Look for your node with `"status": "online"` and a recent `last_seen_at` timestamp.

### Heartbeat Details

The proxy sends heartbeats to `POST /api/v1/nodes/:node_id/heartbeat` at the interval specified by `poll_interval_s` (default: 30 seconds). Each heartbeat can include:

```json
{
  "health": {"cpu_percent": 12.5, "memory_percent": 45.0},
  "metrics": {"requests_per_second": 1500},
  "active_bundle_id": "bundle-uuid-if-running",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

Nodes that stop sending heartbeats for 120 seconds are marked as "offline" by the staleness worker.

## 4. Upgrade to JWT Authentication (Recommended)

The static `node_key` from registration works for authentication but JWT tokens are recommended for production. JWTs are short-lived (12-hour TTL) and signed with Ed25519 keys.

### Prerequisites

Your organization needs an active signing key. Create one in the web UI under **Organization > Signing Keys**, or it will be created automatically on first token request.

### Exchange Key for Token

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/nodes/NODE_ID/token \
  -H "X-Zentinel-Node-Key: sk_abc123def456..."
```

Response:

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6InNrXy4uLiJ9...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_at": "2026-02-24T06:30:00Z",
  "expires_in": 43200
}
```

### Use the JWT

Once you have a token, use it in the `Authorization` header instead of `X-Zentinel-Node-Key`:

```bash
# Heartbeat with JWT
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/nodes/NODE_ID/heartbeat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOi..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"health": {"cpu_percent": 10}}'
```

The proxy should automatically refresh the token before expiry by calling the token endpoint again.

### Authentication Methods

The control plane accepts either method on all node endpoints:

| Method | Header | Use Case |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Static key | `X-Zentinel-Node-Key: sk_...` | Initial setup, simple deployments |
| JWT Bearer | `Authorization: Bearer eyJ...` | Production (recommended) |

## 5. Deploy a Bundle

With a node registered and connected, you can deploy configuration bundles:

1. **Compile a bundle** — Create a bundle via the web UI (Bundles > New Bundle) or the API. The control plane validates the KDL configuration using the `zentinel` binary and packages it as a `.tar.zst` archive.

2. **Create a rollout** — Create a rollout targeting your node(s). Choose a strategy (rolling, canary, blue-green, or all-at-once) and configure health gates.

3. **Node pulls the bundle** — The proxy polls `GET /api/v1/nodes/:node_id/bundles/latest` at its configured interval. When a rollout assigns a new bundle, the response includes a presigned download URL:

```json
{
  "bundle_id": "bundle-uuid",
  "version": "v1.2.3",
  "checksum": "sha256:abc123...",
  "size_bytes": 51200,
  "download_url": "https://s3.../bundle.tar.zst?X-Amz-...",
  "poll_after_s": 30
}
```

When no update is pending:

```json
{
  "no_update": true,
  "poll_after_s": 30
}
```

4. **Node reports status** — After applying the bundle, the proxy reports `active_bundle_id` in its next heartbeat. The rollout engine uses this to track progress and evaluate health gates.

## 6. Reporting Events and Metrics

Registered proxies can send operational data back to the control plane:

### Events

Valid event types: `config_reload`, `bundle_switch`, `error`, `startup`, `shutdown`, `warning`, `info`.
Valid severities: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/nodes/NODE_ID/events \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event_type": "startup",
    "severity": "info",
    "message": "Proxy started successfully"
  }'
```

Batch events:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/nodes/NODE_ID/events \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "events": [
      {"event_type": "bundle_switch", "severity": "info", "message": "Switched to bundle v1.2.3"},
      {"event_type": "info", "severity": "info", "message": "All upstreams healthy"}
    ]
  }'
```

### Metrics

Service-level metrics require `service_id` and `project_id`. These are structured metric snapshots, not free-form key-value pairs:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/nodes/NODE_ID/metrics \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "metrics": [{
      "service_id": "SERVICE_UUID",
      "project_id": "PROJECT_UUID",
      "period_start": "2026-02-23T10:00:00Z",
      "period_seconds": 60,
      "request_count": 1500,
      "error_count": 3,
      "status_2xx": 1450,
      "status_4xx": 47,
      "status_5xx": 3
    }],
    "request_logs": [{
      "service_id": "SERVICE_UUID",
      "project_id": "PROJECT_UUID",
      "timestamp": "2026-02-23T10:00:00Z",
      "method": "GET",
      "path": "/api/health",
      "status": 200,
      "latency_ms": 5
    }]
  }'
```

### WAF Events

WAF events require `rule_type`, `rule_id`, `action`, and `severity`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/nodes/NODE_ID/waf-events \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "events": [{
      "rule_type": "crs",
      "rule_id": "942100",
      "action": "blocked",
      "severity": "warn",
      "client_ip": "1.2.3.4",
      "method": "POST",
      "path": "/login",
      "timestamp": "2026-02-23T10:00:00Z",
      "matched_data": "1 OR 1=1",
      "metadata": {"category": "sql_injection"}
    }]
  }'
```

### Runtime Config

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/nodes/NODE_ID/config \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"config_kdl": "route \"/api/*\" { upstream \"http://api:8080\" }"}'
```

## 7. Bulk Registration

Register multiple nodes with a shell script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

CP_URL="http://localhost:4000"
PROJECT="my-project"

NODES=(
  "proxy-us-east-1:us-east-1:10.0.1.50"
  "proxy-us-west-2:us-west-2:10.0.2.50"
  "proxy-eu-west-1:eu-west-1:10.1.1.50"
  "proxy-ap-south-1:ap-south-1:10.2.1.50"
)

for entry in "${NODES[@]}"; do
  IFS=":" read -r name region ip <<< "$entry"

  echo "Registering $name..."
  response=$(curl -s -X POST "$CP_URL/api/v1/projects/$PROJECT/nodes/register" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{
      \"name\": \"$name\",
      \"labels\": {\"env\": \"production\", \"region\": \"$region\"},
      \"ip\": \"$ip\"
    }")

  node_id=$(echo "$response" | jq -r '.node_id')
  node_key=$(echo "$response" | jq -r '.node_key')

  echo "  node_id: $node_id"
  echo "  node_key: $node_key"

  # Store credentials (adapt to your secrets management)
  echo "$name,$node_id,$node_key" >> node-credentials.csv
done

echo "Done. Credentials saved to node-credentials.csv"
```

**Important:** Protect `node-credentials.csv` — it contains authentication keys that cannot be retrieved again.

## 8. Troubleshooting

### Node Shows as "Offline"

- **Check heartbeats**: Nodes are marked offline after 120 seconds without a heartbeat. Verify the proxy is running and can reach the control plane.
- **Check network**: Ensure the proxy can reach `POST /api/v1/nodes/:node_id/heartbeat` on the control plane host and port.
- **Check credentials**: Verify the `node_id` and `node_key` match the registration response.

### Authentication Failures (401)

| Error Message | Cause | Fix |
|---------------|-------|-----|
| "Missing authentication..." | No auth header sent | Add `X-Zentinel-Node-Key` or `Authorization: Bearer` header |
| "Invalid node key" | Wrong or corrupted static key | Re-register the node to get a new key |
| "Invalid token signature" | JWT signed with wrong key | Re-issue token via `POST /nodes/:id/token` |
| "Token expired" | JWT past 12-hour TTL | Request a new token |
| "Signing key has been deactivated" | Org key was deactivated | Create a new signing key and re-issue tokens |
| "Node not found" | Node was deleted | Re-register the node |

### Bundle Not Pulling

- **No rollout active**: Bundles are only assigned to nodes through rollouts. Create a rollout targeting the node.
- **Rollout paused/failed**: Check rollout status in the dashboard. Health gate failures pause rollouts automatically.
- **Wrong labels**: If the rollout uses label-based targeting, verify the node's labels match the target selector.
- **Poll interval**: The node may not have polled yet. Default interval is 30 seconds.

### Registration Fails (422)

- **Duplicate name**: Node names must be unique within a project. Choose a different name or delete the existing node.
- **Invalid name format**: Names must be 1-100 characters, start with alphanumeric, and contain only alphanumeric characters, underscores, dots, and hyphens.
- **Project not found (404)**: Verify the project slug in the URL matches an existing project.
